# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PACKAGES INSTALLATIONS AND TESTING.
The main aim of this assignment is create Artificial Intelligence environment on a Linux Environment and demostrationg on the availability of Python Packages for developing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Models.


# Packages To be Installed.
   - Python 3
   - Anaconda Environment
   - Jupyter Notebooks
   - Keras
   - Tensorflow
   - Matplotlib
   - Pandas
   - numpy
   - Scikit-learn
   
# Datasets to be used for Testing 
We used Datasets from Softlayer IBM focusing on the Nigeria Carbon Dioxide Emmissions based on the Vehicles types and Engine Sizes. We Focused on creating a model that predicts the level of Carbon dioxide that will be emmitted when a Vehicle with a specific Engine size is being used on the Nigerian cities. 

We used different packages from Matplots, numpy's  to plot graphs and then use a Scikit-learn Linear model to perform a Linear Regression to determine the level of CO2 that will be expected. 

   - DataSet can be found via : [DataSets Link](https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/FuelConsumptionCo2.csv)
